# What is this Project
> :warning: **DO NO TAKE THIS AS A SERIUS IMPLEMENTATION**: This is not how you are supposed to implement theme system in an web page.

This project was created for learning purposes, focusing on the Client and Server side cookies management.

[js-cookie](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-cookie) was used on the Client side to handle the cookies. However, you may see that the page does not change the theme when you click the radio button, this is because there is no state on the app that tells the componens
to update the UI. **You must reload the page to see it**.



## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
